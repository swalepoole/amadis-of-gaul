# amadis-of-gaul
Correcting and formatting different versions of Robert Southey's 1803 translation of Vasco de Lobeira's Amadis of Gaul

www.archive.org has a few scans of this work from various academic libraries available in PDF format, but the machine-created, human-untouched OCR text underlying the images is quite bad.

This is a place to post and update a correct version of the text, and to format it in various outputs. I also intend to submit the results back to archive.org as well as project gutenberg.
